# software_license
Drupal module to provide a software license entity and views

This is beta software. Please test thoroughly before use. Also, it is very specific to our use case. It's certain you'll
need to customize it for your purposes. This module is very specific to Virtualmin/Cloudmin licenses, and how our other
license management tools interact with the database. It may be best to view this as another example of how to implement
an entity and how to tie it to commerce_license, rather than a standalone module.

There is also Commerce License plugin (commerce_license_software_role) that makes it possible to sell licenses via 
Commerce License Billing.
